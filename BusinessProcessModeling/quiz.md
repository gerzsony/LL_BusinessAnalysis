### What is not an effective way to ensure consistency when creating a process model?

- > Explain modeling to business attendees.
- Check if work has already been done in the area you are modeling.
- Verify that the model is color coordinated to prevent confusion.
- Start with what you know then add details as they come to hand.



### The _____ always starts with an individual stakeholder (usually the customer or another entity external to the organization) initiating the transaction.

- Cross-Functional Flow Diagram
- Context Diagram
- Process Flowchart
- > Functional Flow Diagram



### What is the value of Business Process Modeling in an organization?

- It provides the organization with a variety of potential models for future projects.
- These models enable us to represent past states and the way things were done before.
- > It visually demonstrates the flow of activities between various stakeholders and the interaction that enables outcomes to be achieved.
- The textual representation allows business attendees and stakeholders to have a clearer understanding of the process.



### You are creating a Context Diagram for an organization that has the bulk of its IT operations done overseas. What is an example of good practice when creating the diagram?

- Create an elaborate, complex diagram that reviews the internal functionality of the organization.
- > Group all IT operational partners together and label it "IT operations".
- List every external offshore partner of the organization.
- Group all IT entities together and list the advantages of each one.


### When creating a Context Diagram, why should you start with a single page?

- It allows you to write down broad concepts which people should understand on their own.
- Context Diagrams only need to involve the functions that happen internal to an organization.
- It allows you to easily connect the relationships between each external entity and detailed process steps.
- > Having a single page forces you to keep your diagram at the highest level.
- Context Diagram are not designed to show significant levels of detail.



### What are the three common components (also known as building blocks) of a Context Diagram?

- > entities, relationships and processes
- Entities define the stakeholders, relationships show what is being exchanged between the entities and processes are the activities undertaken.
- entities, relationships and well thought out graphics
- relationships, analysis and identifying the actors
- processes, entities and large graphics


### What do Context Diagrams provide?

- > a visual view for how the organization fits within the outside world
- a visual representation of the difficulties identified before the model is created
- a brief explanation of the modeling to be given to the business attendees
- detailed understanding of how a process is undertaken




### Imagine that you're running a functional flow workshop within your organization. What is it important to do while running this workshop?

- Don't worry about getting the initial directional flows mapped and validated.
- > Keep the participants at the functional level.
- Assume involvement.
- Group all IT operational partners separately




### In a Functional Flow Diagram, what do the arrows between each functional area represent?

- what level of data is shared between functional areas
- > the relationship between the two functional areas
- how the merchant requests approval
- a customer initiating a process request





### What should a Functional Flow Diagram always start with?

- a summary of what is outlined in the Context Diagram
- a detailed infographic outlining the key concepts of the diagram
- a list of the business attendees
- > an external stakeholder/customer





### Which statement does NOT apply to a Functional Flow Diagram?

- > It provides a detailed explanation to how the activities are performed.
- It ensures you've covered all the touchpoints within your organization prior to documenting your Cross-Functional Flow Diagram.
- It can be used to target specific audiences when analyzing the detail within each functional area.
- It's a simple model showing each functional area or stakeholder that is internal to your organization, and how they interact in the logical overall flow of work.




### With reference to the diagram provided in the video, what is the purpose of the diamond shape? 

- It represents where the process starts and terminates.
- It captures each action needed to be performed by each actor.
- > It indicates a step in the process where a decision has been made.
- It indicates the direction and order that the activities take place.



### The purpose of the Cross-Functional Flow Diagram is to _____ activities performed by the various _____ from the initial progress trigger to completion.

- capture and order; organizations
- order and validate; business attendees
- > capture and order; stakeholders
- discern and assume; stakeholders



### Suppose you're in charge of organizing the development of these diagrams within your organization. Why is it important to start with a Context Diagram rather than going straight into creating a Cross-Functional Flow diagram?

- This statement is false. You should always start with a Cross-Functional Flow diagram.
- Stakeholders always know what is expected by them and other stakeholders to add expected value.
- This only needs to occur if you don't know your organization well.
- > If you don't understand the context, you will need to do more validating and cross-checking, and possibly have to redo hours of work.


### What does each Cross-Functional Flow Diagram need to start with?

- > a trigger event
- some process box symbols
- a decision diamond
- a validation walkthrough







### What are two common pitfalls when drawing a line between Cross-Functional Flow diagrams and Process Maps? 

- > Trying to create a hybrid version and not understanding the context before starting.
- Making assumptions and not ensuring the Process Map is traced back to the Cross-Functional Flow diagram.
- Starting your modeling journey with detailed Flowchart Diagrams first and not agreeing on standard modeling shapes.
- Trying to create a hybrid version and not taking time to walk through each model individually.



### You are about to start creating a Flowchart diagram. Should you use a round-edged rectangle or a circle as the symbol for the start and end points?

- > You can use either, as long as you are consistent in your diagrams and your stakeholders understand what you mean by your symbols.
- You use neither; the diamond is the symbol used for the start and end points of the process.
- Always use the round edged rectangle.
- You should use the circle.



### What is a central difference between Cross-Functional Flow diagrams and Flowchart diagrams?

- Cross-Functional Flow diagrams contain a lot of detail while Flowchart diagrams do not.
- Cross-Functional flow diagrams work from right to left while Flowchart diagrams work from left to right.
- > Flowchart diagrams do not show the interrelationship with other stakeholders.
- Only Flowchart diagrams use flowchart symbols.



### What do Flowchart Diagrams (also known as Process Maps) document for the organization?

- They only document manual processes.
- > They document the flow of activities performed by a single actor at the lowest level of detail.
- They document the process across different actors.
- They document the main activities needed at a high level.





### What is the final step to getting sign off for approval?

- > Ensure that key stakeholders are present during walkthroughs.
- Target your Subject Matter Expert (SME) audience to meet your standards.
- Use a white board and/or sticky notes.
- Validate your diagrams.




### The more sub-processes you identify in a _____ diagram, the more Flowchart process maps you'll need to create.

- Context Diagram
- > Cross-Functional Flow Diagram
- Flowchart Diagram
- Functional Flow Diagram



### Which diagram explores how your organization fits in the big picture and relates with the outside world, capturing the relationships, inputs, and outputs that help your organization understand what is needed by external entity relationships?

- Cross-Functional Flow Diagram
- Functional Flow Diagram
- > Context Diagram
- Flowchart Diagram



### The _____ focuses on how to complete an end-to-end process across multiple stakeholders.

- > Cross-Functional Flow Diagram
- Context Diagram
- Functional Flow Diagram
- Flowchart Diagram
